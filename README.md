AI Lab is a simulated environment for AI agents to interact with each other.

This project is based on AI Town, a project by [a16z](https://github.com/a16z-infra/ai-town)
and inspired by the paper [Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03442) by Park et al.

The goal of this project is to provide a framework for studying multi-agent interactions in a simulated environment. Currently the project supports simulation of a multi-agent debate on a topic of your choosing. Future work will enable customization of agent personas and development of new scenarios.

- üíª [Stack](#stack)
- üß† [Installation](#installation)
- üë§ [Customize - run YOUR OWN simulated world](#customize-your-own-simulation)
- üèÜ [Credits](#credits)

## Stack

- Game engine, database, and vector search: [Convex](https://convex.dev/)
- Auth: [Clerk](https://clerk.com/)
- Text model: [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models)
- Deployment: [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- Pixel Art Generation: [Replicate](https://replicate.com/), [Fal.ai](https://serverless.fal.ai/lora)
- Background Music Generation: [Replicate](https://replicate.com/) using [MusicGen](https://huggingface.co/spaces/facebook/MusicGen)

## Installation

### Clone repo and Install packages

```bash
git clone https://github.com/a16z-infra/ai-town.git
cd ai-town
npm install
npm run dev
```

`npm run dev` will fail asking for environment variables.
Enter them in the environment variables on your Convex dashboard to proceed.
You can get there via `npx convex dashboard` or https://dashboard.convex.dev
See below on how to get the various environment variables.

a. **Set up Clerk**

- Go to https://dashboard.clerk.com/ and click on "Add Application"
- Name your application and select the sign-in providers you would like to offer users
- Create Application
- Add `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` to `.env.local`

```bash
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_***
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_***
```

- Go to JWT Templates and create a new Convex Template.
- Copy the JWKS endpoint URL for use below.

b. **OpenAI API key**

Visit https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys to get your OpenAI API key and set the
`OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable in your Convex deployment (see below).

c. **Replicate API key (Optional)**
For Daily background music generation, create a
[Replicate](https://replicate.com/) account and create a token in your Profile's
[API Token page](https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens).
Add the token as `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` in your Convex environment variables.

d. **Add environment variables to the Convex backend**

Environment variables for a Convex backend is configured through the dashboard:

```bash
npx convex dashboard
```

Go to "settings" and add the following environment variables. `CLERK_ISSUER_URL` should be the URL from the JWKS endpoint.

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY  sk-*******
CLERK_ISSUER_URL  https://****
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN **** #optional
```

### Run the code

To run both the front and and back end:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You can now visit http://localhost:5173.

If you'd rather run the frontend in a separate terminal from Convex (which syncs
your backend functions as they're saved), you can run these two commands:

```bash
npm run dev:frontend
npm run dev:backend
```

See package.json for details, but dev:backend runs `npx convex dev`

**Note**: The simulation will pause after 5 minutes if the window is idle.
Loading the page will unpause it.
You can also manually freeze & unfreeze the world with a button in the UI.
If you want to run the world without the
browser, you can comment-out the "stop inactive worlds" cron in `convex/crons.ts`.

### Various commands to run / test / debug

**To stop the back end, in case of too much activity**

This will stop running the engine and agents. You can still run queries and
run functions to debug.

```bash
npx convex run testing:stop
```

**To restart the back end after stopping it**

```bash
npx convex run testing:resume
```

**To kick the engine in case the game engine or agents aren't running**

```bash
npx convex run testing:kick
```

**To archive the world**

If you'd like to reset the world and start from scratch, you can archive the current world:

```bash
npx convex run testing:archive
```

Then, you can still look at the world's data in the dashboard, but the engine and agents will
no longer run.

You can then create a fresh world with `init`.

```bash
npx convex run init
```

**To clear all databases**

You can wipe all tables with the `wipeAllTables` testing function.

```bash
npx convex run testing:wipeAllTables
```

**To pause your backend deployment**

You can go to the [dashboard](https://dashboard.convex.dev) to your deployment
settings to pause and un-pause your deployment. This will stop all functions, whether invoked
from the client, scheduled, or as a cron job. See this as a last resort, as
there are gentler ways of stopping above. Once you

### Deploy the app

#### Deploy to Vercel

- Register an account on Vercel and then [install the Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli).
- **If you are using Github Codespaces**: You will need to [install the Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) and authenticate from your codespaces cli by running `vercel login`.
- Deploy the app to Vercel with `vercel --prod`.

#### Deploy Convex functions to prod environment

Before you can run the app, you will need to make sure the Convex functions are deployed to its production environment.

1. Run `npx convex deploy` to deploy the convex functions to production
2. Run `npx convex run init --prod`

If you have existing data you want to clear, you can run `npx convex run testing:debugClearAll --prod`

## Customize your own simulation

NOTE: every time you change character data, you should re-run
`npx convex run testing:debugClearAll` and then
`npm run dev` to re-upload everything to Convex.
This is because character data is sent to Convex on the initial load.
However, beware that `npx convex run testing:debugClearAll` WILL wipe all of your data.

1. Create your own characters and stories: All characters and stories, as well as their spritesheet references are stored in [characters.ts](./data/characters.ts). You can start by changing character descriptions.

2. Updating spritesheets: in `data/characters.ts`, you will see this code:

```ts
export const characters = [
  {
    name: 'f1',
    textureUrl: '/assets/32x32folk.png',
    spritesheetData: f1SpritesheetData,
    speed: 0.1,
  },
  ...
];
```

You should find a sprite sheet for your character, and define sprite motion / assets in the corresponding file (in the above example, `f1SpritesheetData` was defined in f1.ts)

3. Update the background (environment): `data/firstmap.ts` is where the map gets loaded. The easiest way to export a tilemap is by using [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) -- Tiled exports tilemaps as a CSV and you can convert CSV to a 2d array accepted by firstmap.ts
4. Change the background music by modifying the prompt in `convex/music.ts`
5. Change how often to generate new music at `convex/crons.ts` by modifying the `generate new background music` job
