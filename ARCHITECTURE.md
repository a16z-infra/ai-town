# Architecture

This documents dives into the high-level architecture of Cozy Cafe and its different layers. We'll
first start with a brief overview and then go in-depth on each component. The overview should be
sufficient for forking Cozy Cafe and changing game or agent behavior. Read on to the deep dives if
you're interested or running up against the engine's limitations.

This doc assumes the reader has a working knowledge of Convex. If you're new to Convex, check out
the [Convex tutorial](https://docs.convex.dev/get-started) to get started.

## Overview

Cozy Cafe is split into a few layers:

- The server-side game logic in `convex/aiTown`: This layer defines what state Cozy Cafe maintains,
  how it evolves over time, and how it reacts to user input. Both humans and agents submit inputs
  that the game engine processes.
- The client-side game UI in `src/`: Cozy Cafe uses `pixi-react` to render the game state to the
  browser for human consumption.
- The game engine in `convex/engine`: To make it easy to hack on the game rules, we've separated out
  the game engine from the Cozy Cafe-specific game rules. The game engine is responsible for saving
  and loading game state from the database, coordinating feeding inputs into the engine, and
  actually running the game engine in Convex functions.
- The agent in `convex/agent`: Agents run as part of the game loop, and can kick off asynchronous
  Convex functions to do longer processing, such as talking to LLMs. Those functions can save state
  in separate tables, or submit inputs to the game engine to modify game state. Internally, our
  agents use a combination of simple rule-based systems and talking to an LLM.

So, if you'd like to tweak agent behavior but keep the same game mechanics, check out `convex/agent`
for the async work, and `convex/aiTown/agent.ts` for the game loop logic. If you would like to add
new gameplay elements (that both humans and agents can interact with), add the feature to
`convex/aiTown`, render it in the UI in `src/`, and respond to it in `convex/aiTown/agent.ts`.

If you have parts of your game that are more latency sensitive, you can move them out of engine into
regular Convex tables, queries, and mutations, only logging key bits into game state. See "Message
data model" below for an example.

## Cozy Cafe game logic (`convex/aiTown`)

### Data model

Cozy Cafe's data model has a few concepts:

- Worlds (`convex/aiTown/world.ts`) represent a map with many players interacting together.
- Players (`convex/aiTown/player.ts`) are the core characters in the game. Players have human
  readable names and descriptions, and they may be associated with a human user. At any point in
  time, a player may be pathfinding towards some destination and has a current location.
- Conversations (`convex/aiTown/conversations.ts`) are created by a player and end at some point in
  time.
- Conversation memberships (`convex/aiTown/conversationMembership.ts`) indicate that a player is a
  member of a conversation. Players may only be in one conversation at any point in time, and
  conversations currently have exactly two members. Memberships may be in one of three states:
  - `invited`: The player has been invited to the conversation but hasn't accepted yet.
  - `walkingOver`: The player has accepted the invite to the conversation but is too far away to
    talk. The player will automatically join the conversation when they get close enough.
  - `participating`: The player is actively participating in the conversation.

### Schema

There are three main categories of tables:

1. Engine tables (`convex/engine/schema.ts`) for maintaining engine-internal state.
2. Game tables (`convex/aiTown/schema.ts`) for game state. To keep game state small and efficient to
   read and write, we store Cozy Cafe's data model across a few tables. See
   `convex/aiTown/schema.ts` for an overview.
3. Agent tables (`convex/agent/schema.ts`) for agent state. Agents can freely read and write to
   these tables within their actions.

### Inputs (`convex/aiTown/inputs.ts`)

Cozy Cafe modifies its data model by processing inputs. Inputs are submitted by players and agents
and processed by the game engine. We specify inputs in the `inputs` object in
`convex/aiTown/inputs.ts`. Use the `inputHandler` function to construct an input handler, specifying
a Convex validator for arguments for end-to-end type-safety.

- Joining (`join`) and leaving (`leave`) the game.
- Moving a player to a particular location (`moveTo`): Movement in Cozy Cafe is similar to RTS
  games, where the players specify where they want to go, and the engine figures out how to get
  there.
- Starting a conversation (`startConversation`), accepting an invite (`acceptInvite`), rejecting an
  invite (`rejectInvite`), and leaving a conversation (`leaveConversation`). To track typing
  indicators, you use `startTyping` and `finishSendingMessage`. These are imported from
  `game/conversations.ts`.
- Agent inputs are imported from `aiTown/agentInputs.ts` for things like remembering conversations,
  deciding what to do, etc.

Each of these inputs' implementation method checks invariants and updates game state as desired. For
example, the `moveTo` input checks that the player isn't participating in a conversation, throwing
an error telling them to leave the conversation first if so, and then updates their pathfinding
state with the desired destination.

### Simulation

Other than when processing player inputs, the game state can change over time in the background as
the simulation runs time forward. For example, if a player has decided to move along a path, their
position will gradually update as time moves forward. Similarly, if two players collide into each
other, they'll notice and replan their paths, trying to avoid obstacles.

### Message data model

We manage the tables for tracking chat messages in separate tables not affiliated with the game
engine. This is for a few reasons:

- The core simulation doesn't need to know about messages, so keeping them out keeps game state
  small.
- Messages are updated very frequently (when streamed out from OpenAI) and benefit from lower input
  latency, so they're not a great fit for the engine. See "Design goals and limitations" below.

Messages (`convex/schema.ts`) are in a conversation and indicate an author and message text. Each
conversation has a typing state in the conversations table that indicates that a player is currently
typing. Players can still send messages while another player is typing, but having the indicator
helps agents (and humans) not talk over each other.

The separate tables are queried and modified with regular Convex queries and mutations that don't
directly go through the simulation.

## Game engine (`convex/engine`)

Given the description of Cozy Cafe's game behavior in the previous section, the `AbstractGame` class
in `convex/engine/abstractGame.ts` implements actually running the simulation. The game engine has a
few responsibilities:

- Coordinating incoming player inputs, feeding them into the simulation, and sending their return
  values (or errors) to the client.
- Running the simulation forward in time.
- Saving and loading game state from the database.
- Managing executing the game behavior, efficiently using Convex resources and minimizing input
  latency.

Cozy Cafe's game behavior is implemented in the `Game` subclass.

### Input handling

Users submit inputs through the `insertInput` function, which inserts them into an `inputs` table,
assigning a monotonically increasing unique input number and stamping the input with the time the
server received it. The engine then processes inputs, writing their results back to the `inputs`
row. Interested clients can subscribe on an input's status with the `inputStatus` query.

`Game` provides an abstract method `handleInput` that `AiTown` implements with its specific
behavior.

### Running the simulation

The `Game` class specifies how it simulates time forward with the `tick` method:

- `tick(now)` runs the simulation forward until the given timestamp
- Ticks are run at a high frequency, configurable with `tickDuration` (milliseconds). Since Cozy
  Cafe has smooth motion for player movement, it runs at 60 ticks per second.
- It's generally a good idea to break up game logic into separate systems that can be ticked forward
  independently. For example, Cozy Cafe's `tick` method advances pathfinding with
  `Player.tickPathfinding`, player positions with `Player.tickPosition`, conversations with
  `Conversation.tick`, and `Agent.tick` for agent logic.

To avoid running a Convex mutation 60 times per second (which would be expensive and slow), the
engine batches up many ticks into a _step_. Cozy Cafe runs steps at only 1 time per second. Here's
how a step works:

1. Load the game state into memory.
2. Decide how long to run.
3. Execute many ticks for our time interval, alternating between feeding in inputs with
   `handleInput` and advancing the simulation with `tick`.
4. Write the updated game state back to the database.

One core invariant is that the game engine is fully "single-threaded" per world, so there are never
two runs of an engine's step overlapping in time. Not having to think about race conditions or
concurrency makes writing game engine code a lot easier.

However, preserving this invariant is a little tricky. If the engine is idle for a minute and an
input comes in, we want to run the engine immediately but then cancel its run after the minute's up.
If we're not careful, a race condition may cause us to run multiple copies of the engine if an input
comes in just as an idle timeout is expiring!

Our approach is to store a generation number with the engine that monotonically increases over time.
All scheduled runs of the engine contain their expected generation number as an argument. Then, if
we'd like to cancel a future run of the engine, we can bump the generation number by one, and then
we're guaranteed that the subsequent run will fail immediately as it'll notice that the engine's
generation number does not match its expected one.

### Engine state management

The `World`, `Player`, `Conversation`, and `Agent` classes coordinate loading data into memory from
the database, modifying it according to the game rules, and serializing it to write back out to the
database. Here's the flow:

1. The Convex scheduler calls the `convex/aiTown/main.ts:runStep` action.
2. The `runStep` action calls `convex/aiTown/game.ts:loadWorld` to load the current game state. This
   query calls `Game.load`, which loads all of a world's game state from the appropriate tables, and
   returns a `GameState` object, which contains serialized versions of all of the players, agents,
   etc.
3. The `runStep` action passes the `GameState` to the `Game` constructor, which parses the
   serialized versions of all our game objects using their constructors. For example,
   `new Player(serializedPlayer)` parses the database representation into the in-memory `Player`
   class.
4. The engine runs the simulation, modifying the in-memory game objects.
5. At the end of a step, the framework calls `Game.saveStep`, which computes a diff of the game
   state since the beginning of the step and passes the diff to the
   `convex/aiTown/game.ts:saveWorld` mutation.
6. The `saveWorld` mutation applies the diff to the database, notices if any deleted objects need to
   be archived, updates the `participatedTogether` graph, and kicks off any scheduled jobs to run.
7. Since the engine is the only mutator of game state, it continues to run steps for some amount of
   time without repeating steps 1 to 3 again.

Just as we assume that the game engine is "single threaded", we also assume that the game engine
_exclusively_ owns the tables that store game engine state. Only the game engine should
programmatically modify these tables, so components outside the engine can only mutate them by
sending inputs.

### Historical tables

If we're only writing updates out to the database at the end of the step, and steps are only running
at once per second, continuous quantities like position will only update every second. This, then,
defeats the whole purpose of having high-frequency ticks: Player positions will jump around and look
choppy.

To solve this, we track the historical values of quantities like position _within_ a step, storing
the value at the end of each tick. Then, the client receives both the current value _and_ the past
step's worth of history, and it can "replay" the history to make the motion smooth.

The game tracks these quantities at the end of each tick by feeding them to a `HistoricalObject`.
This object efficiently tracks its changes over time and serializes them into a buffer that clients
can use for replaying its history. There are a few limitations on `HistoricalObject`:

- Historical objects can only have numeric (floating point) values and can't have nested objects or
  optional fields.
- Historical objects must declare which fields they'd like to track.

We store each player's "location" (i.e. its position, orientation, and speed) in a
`HistoricalObject` and write it to the `worlds` document at the end of a step when computing a diff.

## Client-side game UI (`src/`)

One guiding principle for Cozy Cafe's architecture is to keep the usage as close to "regular Convex"
usage as possible. So, game state is stored in regular tables, and the UI just uses regular
`useQuery` hooks to load that state and render it in the UI.

The one exception is for historical tables, which feed in the latest state into a
`useHistoricalValue` hook that parses the history buffer and replays time forward for smooth motion.
To keep replayed time synchronized across multiple historical buffers, we provide a
`useHistoricalTime` hook for the top of your app that keeps track of the current time and returns it
for you to pass down into components.

We also provide a `useSendInput` hook that wraps `useMutation` and automatically sends inputs to the
server and waits for the engine to process them and return their outcome.

## Agent architecture (`convex/agent`)

### The agent loop (`convex/game/agents.ts`)

Agents will execute any game state changes, and schedule operations to do anything that requires a
long-lived request or accessing non-game tables. The flow generally is:

1. Logic in `Agent.tick` can read and modify game state as time progresses, such as waiting until
   the agent is near another player to start talking.
2. When there is something that needs to talk to an LLM or read/write external data, it calls
   `startOperation` with a reference to a Convex function: generally an `internalAction`.
3. This function can read state from game tables and other tables via `internalQuery` functions.
4. It executes long-running tasks, and can write data via `internalMutation`s. Game state should not
   be written, but rather submitted via `inputs` (described in a previous section).
5. Inputs are submitted from actions with `ctx.runMutation(api.game.main.sendInput, {...})` from
   actions or via `insertInput` from mutations. They are referenced by their name as a string, like
   `moveTo`.
6. Inputs are defined with `inputHandler` and are given an instance of the AiTown game to modify,
   similar to the game loop. In fact, these are called as part of the game loop before `tickAgent`.
7. When an operation is done, it deletes the `inProgressOperation`. This is to ensure an agent only
   is trying to do one thing at a time.
8. `Agent.tick` then can observe the new game state and continue to make decisions.

### Conversations (`convex/agent/conversations.ts`)

The agent code calls into the conversation layer which implements the prompt engineering for
injecting personality and memories into the GPT responses. It has functions for starting a
conversation (`startConversation`), continuing after the first message (`continueConversation`), and
politely leaving a conversation (`leaveConversation`). Each function loads structured data from the
database, queries the memory layer for the agent's opinion about the player they're talking with,
and then calls into the OpenAI client (`convex/util/openai.ts`).

### Memories (`convex/agent/memory.ts`)

After each conversation, GPT summarizes its message history, and we compute an embedding of the
summary text and write it into Convex's vector database. Then, when starting a new conversation
with, Danny, we embed "What you think about Danny?", find the three most similar memories, and fetch
their summary texts to inject into the conversation prompt.

### Embeddings cache (`convex/agent/embeddingsCache.ts`)

To avoid computing the same embedding over and over again, we cache embeddings by a hash of their
text in a Convex table.

## Design goals and limitations

Cozy Cafe's game engine has a few design goals:

- Try to be as close to a regular Convex app as possible. Use regular client hooks (like `useQuery`)
  when possible, and store game state in regular tables.
- Be as similar to existing engines as possible, so it's easy to change the behavior. We chose a
  `tick()` based model for simulation since it's commonly used elsewhere and intuitive.
- Decouple agent behavior from the game engine. It's nice to allow human players and AI agents to do
  all the same things in the game.

These design goals imply some inherent limitations:

- All data is loaded into memory each step. The active game state loaded by the game should be small
  enough to fit into memory and load and save frequently. Try to keep game state to less than a few
  dozen kilobytes: Games that require tens of thousands of objects interacting together may not be a
  good fit.
- All inputs are fed through the database in the `inputs` table, so applications that require very
  large or frequent inputs may not be a good fit.
- Input latency will be around one RTT (time for the input to make it to the server and the response
  to come back) plus half the step size (for expected server input delay when the input's waiting
  for the next step). Historical values add another half step size of input latency since their
  values are viewed slightly in the past. As configured, this will roughly be around 1.5s of input
  latency, which won't be a good fit for competitive games. You can configure the step size to be
  smaller (e.g. 250ms) which will decrease input latency at the cost of adding more Convex function
  calls and database bandwidth.
- The game engine is designed to be single threaded. JavaScript operating over plain objects
  in-memory can be surprisingly fast, but if your simulation is very computationally expensive, it
  may not be a good fit on Cozy Cafe's engine today.
